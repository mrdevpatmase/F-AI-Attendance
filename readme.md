# 🎯 Face Recognition Attendance System

This project uses **face recognition** to automatically mark attendance using a webcam. It captures face images, generates encodings, and detects students in real-time — storing attendance records in a `.csv` file.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Capture Face Images**

   - Run `capture_faces.py` to store face images of each person in `dataset/<person_name>/`.

2. **Generate Encodings**

   - Run `gen_encoding.py` to convert those images into encodings and save them in `encodings.pkl`.

3. **Mark Attendance**
   - Run `detect_attendence.py` to detect faces using a webcam.
   - If the face matches, it logs the name, date, and time in `attendance.csv`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – for capturing and processing images
- [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) – for facial feature detection
- [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) – for storing encodings
- [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) – for attendance logs
